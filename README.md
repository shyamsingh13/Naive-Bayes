# Naive-Bayes

We have perform Nave bayes and due to this we got to know where to use the nave bayes algorithm. 
As for more of the dataset which I was using I got bad result because it gives us the prediction on one x variable
which has highest strong relationship to other x variables. But in scenarios like sentimental analysis and spam filteration
it will perform good.

So here have took the dataset of the AdultKNN , mobileprice dataset Along with that in mobileprice dataset we have also perform
the grid search to get better parameter in decision tree and random forest.

# 1.Adultknn dataset ---

Just performing the naive bayes\

just refer KNN repo for more.


# 2.mobileprice dataset ---

here along buidling nave bayes algorithm we have perform the grid search to find the better parameter for decision tree and random forest

just refer KNN repo for more.
